This is an MVP for an API app that allows users to keep track of their sleeping habits. the current database used is a throwway sqlite3. Although there is dummy data in a seed file, it is recommended to interact with the API using the designated routes below.

== Usage

- Git clone this repository
- Install dependencies with `bundle install`
- Install the basic seed data `rails db:seed`
- Start up a server `rail s`

=== Routes

- To test the routes, it is recommended to use a service like {url-potsman}[Postman].

  # GET /users returns a list of users and attributes

1. "Clock In" operation, and return all "clocked-in" times, ordered by created time.

  # POST /users/:user_id/clock_in

2. Users can follow and unfollow other users.

  # POST users/:user_id/follow/:user_id
  # POST users/:user_id/unfollow/:user_id

3. See the sleep records over the past week for their friends,
ordered by the length of their sleep.

  # GET users/:user_id/friends_sleep_records

== Process Thoughts

My initial thought is that in order to "let users track when they go to bed and when they wake up", there will also need to be a "clock_out" action, aswell as a "clock_in" action.

This could be done in two ways, the first option is to create two separate POST routes (one for clocking in, the other for clocking out).

The other option is to simply use a "toggle" on one simple route;
when "clock_in" action is called, it first checks whether there are any ongoing sleeps.

This makes sense though may create a later limitation if the program needs to be extended with some other functionality.
The brief does not seem to be specific in this regard, so I will go down the "toggle" route.

== Requirements

* Ruby version 
  - ruby 3.0.0

* System dependencie
  - rails
  - sqlite3
  - puma

== Limitations

- The most significant limitation so far is that there are no tests.
  Moving beyond this point it would be essential to first introduce tests.
- Clarity can be brought to what is meant by "past week" as there are some very slight nuances.
- It appears that the User controller has too many reasons to change, thereby giving the impression, that some methods currently on it are not its responibility (see below diagram).
  - A solution would be to extract some methods to module(s) outside of this class.

Here is a UML diagram that shows the current structure:

== Brief

We want to know how you structure the code and design the API.
We would like you to implement a "good night" application to let users track when they go to bed and when they wake up.

We require some restful APIS to achieve the following:

1. "Clock In" operation, and return all "clocked-in" times, ordered by created time.
2. Users can follow and unfollow other users.
3. See the sleep records over the past week for their friends,
ordered by the length of their sleep.

What do we mean by "past week"? 7 days, or from Monday, or 7 * 24 hours... etc

Please implement the model, db migrations, and JSON API.
You can assume that there are only two fields on the users "id" and "name".

You do not need to implement any user registration API.

You can use any gems you like.
After you finish the project, please send me your GitHub project link.

We want to see all of your development commits
