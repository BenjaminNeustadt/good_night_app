This is an MVP for an API app that allows users to keep track of their sleeping habits. the current database used is a throwway sqlite3. Although there is dummy data in a seed file, it is recommended to interact with the API using the designated routes below.

== Usage

- Git clone this repository
- Install dependencies with `bundle install`

Run:

- `rails db:migrate` (to create the database tables)
- `rails db:seed` (to install basic seed data)

To run the tests:

- `bundle exec rspec -fd`

To start up a server:

- `rail s`

=== Routes

- To test the routes, it is recommended to use a service like {url-potsman}[Postman].

  # GET /users returns a list of users and attributes

__It should look something like this:__

image::users_get_route.png[example of users GET route]

1. "Clock In" operation, and return all "clocked-in" times, ordered by created time.

  # POST /users/:user_id/sleeps/track

2. Users can follow and unfollow other users.

  # POST users/:user_id/follow/:user_id
  # POST users/:user_id/unfollow/:user_id

3. See the sleep records over the past week for their friends,
ordered by the length of their sleep.

  # GET users/:user_id/friends_sleep_records

__It should look like this (the sleep duration is reported in minutes):__

== Process Thoughts

My initial thought is that in order to "let users track when they go to bed and when they wake up", there will also need to be a "clock_out" action, aswell as a "clock_in" action.

This could be done in two ways, the first option is to create two separate POST routes (one for clocking in, the other for clocking out).

The other option is to simply use a "toggle" on one simple route;
when "clock_in" action is called, it first checks whether there are any ongoing sleeps, if there are then it simply "closes"/"clocks_out" on the ongoing sleep in question.

This makes sense, though may create a later limitation if the program needs to be extended with some other functionality. The solution is to ensure that the "clock_in" and "clock_out" methods are distinct, even if they are called from within one method.

The brief does not seem to be specific in this regard, so I will go down the "toggle" route.

After a refactor, the route for "clocking in" is now:

  # POST /users/:user_id/sleeps/track

The "track" word is obviously different from "clock_in"; to resolve this we could create an alias method "clock_in" which would call "track", or otherwise rethink the design.

== Requirements

* Ruby version 
  - ruby 3.0.0

* System dependencies
  - Rails
  - Sqlite3
  - Puma
  - active_model_serializers

== Limitations

- Some further tests could be written (i.e. for 'Follows')
- Clarity can be brought to what is meant by "past week" as there are some slight nuances.

Here is a UML diagram that shows the previous structure:

After a refactor stage the structure is as follows:

== Brief

We want to know how you structure the code and design the API.
We would like you to implement a "good night" application to let users track when they go to bed and when they wake up.

We require some restful APIS to achieve the following:

1. "Clock In" operation, and return all "clocked-in" times, ordered by created time.
2. Users can follow and unfollow other users.
3. See the sleep records over the past week for their friends,
ordered by the length of their sleep.

What do we mean by "past week"? 7 days, or from Monday, or 7 * 24 hours... etc

Please implement the model, db migrations, and JSON API.
You can assume that there are only two fields on the users "id" and "name".

You do not need to implement any user registration API.

You can use any gems you like.
After you finish the project, please send me your GitHub project link.

We want to see all of your development commits
